# LD43-Sacrifices-must-be-made
entry for Ludum Dare Game Jam 43 - theme "Sacrifices must be made"

You control the flying bomb with the WASD keys and the mouse. (thanks to Why485
on Youtube and his source on https://github.com/brihernandez/MouseFlight)

Fly the bomb into enemy AA guns. Once you've died, time will be rewinded and you will fly another bomb.
The previous bomb will follow the exact path you flew earlier.

The game ends when all AA guns (and 2 red headquarters) have been disabled.

known issues:
- reticle points a little higher than where you are, so you have to aim a little bit above target
- no menu
- AA guns don't shoot in the same patter when you rewind time
